= Scripting Languages Design and Implementation =

== Project 1 ==

Complete each of the scripts in the ./scripts directory according to
the specification in the comments.

You do not need to use bash, sed or awk.

These are, however, the recommended tools.

You can use any programming language you want that exists on the
server, as long as the script has the desired behavior when executed.

If you'd like a language installed, please let me know.

WARNING: Do not delete the comment lines.  The project spec may be
updated/clarified, and in the process, these comments may be updated.
If you modify them, you could might get conflicts when you pull
changes from the master.

Make regular commits to your private repository so that if you crash
at the last minute you have a backup *and* you can prove to me that
you really were working on it.

If you think a specification is ambiguous, please email immediately
for a ruling.
